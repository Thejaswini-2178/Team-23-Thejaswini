        <p>Paragraphs are usually made up of a topic sentence, body sentences, and a concluding sentence. The topic sentence introduces the main idea, and the body sentences develop it. 
Purpose.
Paragraphs help organize ideas in a logical order, and guide the reader through the written work. They also show where the subdivisions of a piece of writing begin and end. 
Length
Paragraphs can vary in length, but are usually around 250 words and consist of five or six sentences. However, in some writing styles, such as journalism, paragraphs can be as short as one sentence. 
Indentation
A new paragraph is indicated by a new indentation, which is usually five spaces or the tab button on a computer. 
Unity
A paragraph should focus on a single idea, and not mix ideas or thoughts. 
Transition
A paragraph break is used to transition between ideas, add a new line of thought, or sum up. 
The word paragraph comes from the Latin word paragraphos, which roughly means "a break in writing".
