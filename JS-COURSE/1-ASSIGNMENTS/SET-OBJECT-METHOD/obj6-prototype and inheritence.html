        //         Object Prototype and Inheritance
        // What is the prototype of an object?
        // It's an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.
        // What is the difference between __proto__ and prototype?
        // __proto__ is the actual prototype of an object, while prototype is a property of constructor functions used for inheritance.
        // How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?
        // Using prototypes, Object.create(), or ES6 classes.
