        // Object Prototype and Inheritance
        // What is the prototype of an object?
        // It's an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.
        // What is the difference between __proto__ and prototype?
        // __proto__ is the actual prototype of an object, while prototype is a property of constructor functions used for inheritance.
        // How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?
        // Using prototypes, Object.create(), or ES6 classes.
        var original = {}
        console.log(original)
        console.log(original.__proto__)

        var person = {
            name: "theju"
        }
        console.log(person.__proto__)

        const obj = { a: 10 }; // obj is created from Object prototype
        console.log(obj.a.__proto__)

        // implementing the inheritence in js using the prototype method
